SCBFGS
======

This is SCBFGS version 1.0.  It has only moderately been tested.  If you encounter any significant bugs, then please contact [Frank E. Curtis](mailto:frank.e.curtis@gmail.com).

Overview
--------

SCBFGS (Self-Correcting BFGS Algorithm for Stochastic Optimization) is a prototype code for solving stochastic optimization problems.  The code allows various algorithmic options, each trying to exploit the self-correcting properties of BFGS-type updating. A sample logistic regression problem is provided in order to illustrate how other problems can be formulated and solved with the code.

The code is written in Matlab and released under the MIT License.
